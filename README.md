# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Spotify session data from the Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (Brost et al.) paper. The question I was attempting to solve for was 'can we predict track skip rate?'.

# File Descriptions
The code for this project is contained in a single Jupyter (ipynb) notebook. This code works sequentially through all steps of the data science process, which are clearly signposted by markdown cells.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available  [here]().

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
